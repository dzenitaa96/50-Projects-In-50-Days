# Blurry loading

Creating a Blurry loading page. In this case we create a page where the background image starts as completely blurred and then clears out as the numbers on the screen go from 0 to 100%.

### Used resources

- [Stackoverflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10756313/javascript-jquery-map-a-range-of-numbers-to-another-range-of-numbers): Used for creating the `scale` function which helped in linking the effect to the range of numbers (the percentage);
