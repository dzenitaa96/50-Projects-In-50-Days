            <h3 class="faq-title">What storage conditions are required for chocolate? </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">Always keep chocolate away from moisture and excessive heat: these are the two factors that destroy chocolate more rapidly than all others.  Also, chocolate should be stored in a cool, dark place, away from strong odours that can taint its flavour, at a constant temperature between 12 and 20Â°C.  Always ensure that the packaging used to store chocolate is properly closed.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-title">What is tempering chocolate?</h3>
            <p class="faq-text">The purpose of tempering chocolate is to pre-crystallise the cocoa butter in the chocolate, which is related to the working temperature of the chocolate.  During tempering, the cocoa butter in the chocolate changes into a stable crystalline form.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-title">How do I temper chocolate?</h3>
            <p class="faq-text">The easiest way is by adding chocolate, which has already been tempered, to the melted chocolate.  Any of the chocolate chips sold on our website may used for this because they have already been tempered.  In other words, they are already in the required crystalline form.  Please see our leaflet in Recipes and Tips, Tempering Chocolate for detailed information.</p>
